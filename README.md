# Project_Fridgi
This is a project for a smart fridge that I am making with my boss, Urlich Bachman. 

The first script that I wrote with this project focused on using the Photoresistor sensor with the pi and initiating an email every time someone opens the fridge.

The second script is a motion detection script that will begin to capture video when it senses movement. I'm still trying to figure out where it saves.... :O
